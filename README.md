In this project I implement a chip component using React. This chip component allows users to select items from a list and turn them into chips.
#Features Includes : 
- Click on the input field to see a list of items.
- As the user types, the list updates to show matching items.
- Clicking on the item turn it into a chip at the top.
- Pressing the space when the input is blank highlights the last chip.
